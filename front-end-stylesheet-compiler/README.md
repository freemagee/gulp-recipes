## Front-end compiler

This task is meant to compile and serve front-end assets with browser reload showing new changes

### WIP

This is a non working gulpfile as of 2018-08-22

### Reasons

Exploring writing the gulpfile with ES6 and using the features of Gulp 4.x. This particular gulp recipe has better error handling and debug information for use in the console.
