# Gulp 4 and ES6 syntax

Pretty different to Gulp 3.x!

## Task explanation

This is a made up task. But it does represent a common process. Take some assets. Process them. Either serve them in a development environment. Or compile them for production.

At the moment this example just caters for SCSS to CSS conversion.

For more info, install the packages then type `gulp -T`.
